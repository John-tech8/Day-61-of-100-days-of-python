# Day-61-of-100-days-of-python
 Today I built an **advanced “My Top 10 Movies” web app** using Flask and databases. Implemented full CRUD functionality — viewing, adding, editing ratings/reviews, deleting entries, and dynamically ranking movies by rating.  This project strengthened my understanding of backend workflows, database integration, and building interactive web apps.
